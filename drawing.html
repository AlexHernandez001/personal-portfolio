                                    Before I made any of my websites I prototyped them in the site figma. I both used it
                                    solo and in a collaboration with others. What I set out to do was to make a model to
                                    follow when I start coding the website.
                                    I used many concepts in the process of making a wireframe. The first was UX in which
                                    you make sure that the user would enjoy the website. Another is the organization
                                    since you how to set up where everything goes in a satisfying way. The last one is
                                    being clear it is vital that wireframe is through in order to alleviate future
                                    problems.
                                    The successes I had were when I got to the point where I could reference it reliably
                                    when writing code. A challenge I faced was making something I was satisfied with.
                                    The CART “Habits of Mind” I used in this was “Collaboration” since my peers often
                                    struggled the same way I did and sometimes we were working on a website together.
                                    Another I used was “Persistence” in continuing to work on the projects even when I
                                    got frustrated. Finally I practiced “Reflecting” and I used this to improve on the
                                    next website I made.

                                            As part of endeavoring to make my website visually appealing I used Canva.
                                            Canva is a tool that is used in education to create projects that not only
                                            look great but also help teach students the basics of digital design. My
                                            goal when using this website is to make well realized designs.
                                            I use many concepts in Canva. One of the concepts I utilized was the mood
                                            board which I used to instill a certain feeling into my projects. Another
                                            one I use is design innovation which I use to be original and to improve on
                                            other designs.
                                            The successes I experienced were making colorful, lively projects as well as
                                            gaining inspiration to use in other projects. The challenges I faced were
                                            getting started since I have trouble getting inspiration when I want to be
                                            inspired, and learning how to mix colors in a way that looks aesthetically
                                            pleasing.
