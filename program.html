                                    I have made a few websites, on Visual Studio Code, over the course of the year both
                                    alone and in a group. The three coding languages I learned and used were HTML5,
                                    CSS3, and JavaScript. The goal I had when using this software was to use the
                                    different coding languages to make a functioning website.
                                    There were many concepts I learned when using this software. The first was the
                                    concept of variables in which they store information in order to be used in the
                                    future. The second was how to
                                    properly organize information and code. The last was learning how to make my code
                                    fit with the syntax(rules) of it.
                                    The success I had was getting my websites to work the way I intended and for them to
                                    look good. I had a lot of challenges when doing this but some of the main ones were
                                    making the logic between the code work and
                                    making the code fit within the syntax of it.
                                    The CART “Habits of Mind” I used in this was “Collaboration” since my peers often
                                    struggled the same way I did andsometimes we were working on a website together.
                                    Another I used was “Persistence” in
                                    continuing to work on the projects even when I got frustrated. Finally I practiced
                                    “Reflecting” and I used this to improve on the next website I made.

                                            In order to stylize my website to make it look appealing I use CSS. How CSS
                                            works is that it has a selector which determines what it affects, a
                                            declaration which is where the info is stored, then the property which
                                            determines how it is affected, and the value specifies further what the
                                            property is doing. The goal when using this is to visually appeal to a user
                                            in order to amplify their experience.
                                            The first concept I utilized was consistency which allows for a simpler time
                                            reading and understanding the code. The second concept is to be brief and
                                            clear. This allows for the code to be followed consistently and unanimously.
                                            The third concept is Separation which emphasizes putting rules on only one
                                            class selector.
                                            The successes I achieved were making my website stand out compared to my
                                            competitors and to make my website flow well. The challenges I faced was
                                            properly combining the code to create the overall aesthetic I wanted and
                                            correctly applying declaration to the right selector.
                                            The CART “Habits of Mind” I used in this was “Collaboration” since my peers
                                            often struggled the same way I did and sometimes we were working on a
                                            website together. Another I used was “Persistence” in continuing to work on
                                            the projects even when I got frustrated. Finally I practiced “Reflecting”
                                            and I used this to improve on the next code I wrote.
